## Creating Easyparcel Application
### Create an Application

To access the API, you need to create an application:

1. In the Developer Hub dashboard, click on **Applications**
2. Click **Create New Application**

<p align="center">
<img alt="image" style="max-width: 105%; height: auto;" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddb518b3-e6c5-4e46-82fb-34acc2d8a756" />
</p>

4. Fill in the application details:

   - Application name
   - Redirect URI (for OAuth flows)

<p align="center">
<img alt="image" style="max-width: 105%; height: auto;" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df84109c-b2ea-44b4-a22c-64169ec5e26b" />
</p>

## Understanding Redirect URI

The **Redirect URI** (also known as callback URL) is a crucial component of the OAuth 2.0 authentication flow. Here's what you need to know:

**What is a Redirect URI?**
A redirect URI is the URL in your application where Easy Parcel will send users after they successfully authenticate. It's essentially the "return address" for the OAuth flow.

**Why is it required?**
- **Security**: Ensures that authorization codes are only sent to pre-registered, trusted URLs
- **OAuth Compliance**: Required by OAuth 2.0 specification to prevent authorization code interception attacks
- **User Experience**: Provides a seamless flow back to your application after authentication

**How to configure your Redirect URI:**

 **For Web Applications:**
   ```
   https://yourdomain.com/auth/callback

   https://yourapp.com/oauth/easyparcel/callback
   ```

 **For Local Development:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/auth/callback

   http://127.0.0.1:8080/callback
   ```

 **For Mobile Applications:**
   ```
   yourapp://oauth/callback

   com.yourcompany.yourapp://auth
   ```


## Once create the app

### Access Token Expiry Configuration
Easy Parcel allows you to configure the expiry time for access tokens based on your application's security requirements and user experience needs.
<p align="center">
<img  alt="image" style="max-width: 105%; height: auto;"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/342f75f4-db5e-4dae-aedd-fda5db2f561e" />
</p>
**What are Access Tokens?**
Access tokens are credentials that allow your application to access Easy Parcel's API on behalf of authenticated users. They have a limited lifespan for security purposes.

**Why Configure Token Expiry?**

- **Security**: Shorter expiry times reduce the risk if tokens are compromised

- **User Experience**: Longer expiry times reduce the frequency of re-authentication

- **Compliance**: Meet your organization's security policies and regulations

**How to Set Token Expiry:**
1. In your application settings, look for Access Token expiration
2. Select your preferred expiry duration from the dropdown
3. Consider your application type and security requirements
4. Save the configuration

**Best Practices by Application Type:**

**Web Applications:**

- **Recommended**: 1-4 hours

- **Rationale**: Balance between security and user experience

- **Implementation**: Use refresh tokens for seamless renewal

**Mobile Applications:**

- **Recommended**: 24 hours to 7 days

- **Rationale**: Reduces frequent login prompts on mobile devices

- **Implementation**: Implement background token refresh

**Server-to-Server Integrations:**

- **Recommended**: 1-24 hours

- **Rationale**: Automated systems can handle frequent token refresh

- **Implementation**: Automatic token renewal in your backend

**Public/Kiosk Applications:**
- **Recommended**: 15-60 minutes

- **Rationale**: Higher security risk in public environments

- **Implementation**: Frequent re-authentication acceptable



### Fill in the application details:
- description (optional)
- Application logo (optional)
