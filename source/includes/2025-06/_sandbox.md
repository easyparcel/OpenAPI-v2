## Sandbox Limitations

While the EasyParcel **sandbox environment** allows full API integration testing, there are several limitations compared to the live environment.


### ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Limitations

* **Shipment status will not update**

   Any shipment created in the sandbox will remain static ‚Äî it will not progress through actual delivery stages.

* **No tracking notifications**

   Add-on features such as SMS, email, and WhatsApp tracking notifications will not be triggered or sent.



Use the sandbox for development and testing purposes. For real transactions and shipment tracking, switch to the production environment.
